      manifest.json provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. See https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <title>First React App</title>


    <!-- Create your first React App!
    In this exercise you are going to create your own book store by using React Components!
    Use the create-react-app boilerplate to create your new React application
    Install and set up bootstrap + react-bootstrap in your app
    Create a MyNav component which will render a bootstrap navigation bar with the following links: Home, About and Browse. Note: we don't know how to perform navigation yet, so for now just put "#" as the href for each one on them
    Create a MyFooter component which will render a footer for the page
    Create a Welcome component with a Jumbotron and a subtitle for your shop
    Create a Latest Release component. This component should read from one of the json files and print out the cover of the books
    Push everything on GitHub and publish on Eduflow before 17:00 CET -->
